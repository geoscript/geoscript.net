About GeoScript
===============

The goal of the GeoScript project is to provide an easy to use geo processing library in a variety of scripting environments.

GeoScript is based extensively on the `GeoTools <https://geotools.org>`_ library. GeoTools provides all the underlying GIS functionality such as support for spatial data formats, rendering, reprojection, and more.
