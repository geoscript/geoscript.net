Description: Paver is a Python-based build/distribution/deployment scripting tool along the
        lines of Make or Rake. What makes Paver unique is its integration with
        commonly used Python libraries. Common tasks that were easy before remain
        easy. More importantly, dealing with *your* applications specific needs and
        requirements is also easy.
