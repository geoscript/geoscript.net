Quick-Start
===========

For now, you'll have to brave git and clone the `repo <http://github.com/tschaub/geoscript/tree/master>`_. Find some detail on the `Narwhal site <http://narwhal.js>`_ about getting started with Narwhal packages.

Have faith, this site will eventually provide good docs for getting started with GeoScript.
